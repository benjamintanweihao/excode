## Starting the Application

To start your new Phoenix application:

1. Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
2. Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`

Now you can visit `localhost:4000` from your browser.

## Roadmap

Here is how it looks like so far:

Special thanks to [Zaven Muradyan](https://github.com/voithos/swiftcode) for the original code.

## Heroku Notes

For Heroku deployments, you need to manually include the assets that were automatically generated by Phoenix.

```
% find priv -type file | grep -v .DS_Store | xargs git add -f
```
